Using generator for language: JAVASRC: JavaSrcCpgGenerator
Creating project `_Defects4J1.2` for code at `P:\Defects4J_java\1.2`
=======================================================================================================
Invoking CPG generator in a separate process. Note that the new process will consume additional memory.
If you are importing a large codebase (and/or running into memory issues), please try the following:
1) exit joern
2) invoke the frontend: P:\joern-cli\javasrc2cpg.bat -J-Xmx8142m P:\Defects4J_java\1.2 --output C:\Users\Noah\workspace\_Defects4J1.2\cpg.bin.zip
3) start joern, import the cpg: `importCpg("path/to/cpg")`
=======================================================================================================

moving cpg.bin.zip to cpg.bin because it is already a database file
Creating working copy of CPG to be safe
Loading base CPG from: C:\Users\Noah\workspace\_Defects4J1.2\cpg.bin.tmp
Code successfully imported. You can now query it using `cpg`.
For an overview of all imported code, type `workspace`.
